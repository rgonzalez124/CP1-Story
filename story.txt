My mom woke me up at 6:30
I put my clothes on in the dark
I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and pee
I took the bus to school and came 20 minutes late
I fell asleep in my second period because we were doing the EOY
I went to third period
I went to fourth period
I stayed awake until my lunch period and ate an apple
After my apple, I went outside to play soccer
I bought an Arizona and took the bus home
I went to IHop at 5pm to eat pancakes
I went back home to watch tv
I fell asleep for 3 hours 
When I woke up, I played a game for 4 hours and then ate cereal at 4am
I watched tv for 2 more hours and then slept at 6am
